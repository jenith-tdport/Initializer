SIMPLE PROMPT FOR ANY AI:
=========================

Just say this to ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI:

"Read the instructions in this CSV file and follow them exactly. Add 50 new quiz questions at the end and return the complete file."

Then paste the contents of: initializer_with_better_instructions.csv

That's it! The file now contains everything the AI needs.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NEW FILE:
- Explicit instruction to ROTATE answers (A,B,C,D)
- Clear examples showing answer rotation
- Warning about what NOT to do (all A's)
- Reminder after every 4 questions to check balance
- Specific numbers: "Make 12-13 with A, 12-13 with B, etc."
- Clear directive: "Return COMPLETE file"

The AI should now:
1. Keep all instructions and existing questions
2. Add 50 new questions with BALANCED answers
3. Return everything in one file ready to use
