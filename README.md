### Adding More Questions to Expand the Game

The game loads questions from `/public/data/initializer.csv`. You can easily add more acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations to make the game larger and more challenging.

#### CSV File Format
Each row in the CSV represents one question with these columns:
```csv
term,kind,category,question,optionA,optionB,optionC,optionD,correct,explanation
```

#### Column Definitions:
- **term**: The acronym/initialism itself (e.g., "CPU", "NASA", "LOL")
- **kind**: Type of abbreviation - use one of:
  - `initialism` - Pronounced letter by letter (FBI, CPU, ATM)
  - `acronym` - Pronounced as a word (NASA, RADAR, SCUBA)
  - `backronym` - Acronym created after the word existed
- **category**: Topic area for future filtering features:
  - `computing` - Technology and computer terms
  - `technology` - General tech and gadgets
  - `science` - Scientific terms
  - `business` - Corporate and economic terms
  - `government` - Government agencies and political terms
  - `education` - Academic terms
  - `internet` - Online culture and social media
  - `general` - Everyday abbreviations
  - `medical` - Healthcare terms
  - `military` - Defense and military terms
  - Add your own categories as needed!
- **question**: The question text (usually "What does [TERM] stand for?")
- **optionA, optionB, optionC, optionD**: Four answer choices
- **correct**: Which option is correct (must be A, B, C, or D)
- **explanation**: Educational text shown after answering (keep it concise)

#### Example of Adding New Questions:

```csv
RADAR,acronym,military,What does RADAR stand for?,Radio Detection And Ranging,Rapid Detection And Response,Remote Area Detection And Reconnaissance,Radio Distance And Range,A,RADAR was originally an acronym but is now used as a standard word.
SCUBA,acronym,sports,What does SCUBA stand for?,Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus,Submersible Craft Using Breathing Air,Special Compressed Underwater Breathing Aid,Submarine Crew Underwater Breathing Apparatus,A,SCUBA diving equipment allows underwater breathing without surface air supply.
YOLO,acronym,internet,What does YOLO stand for?,You're Only Living Once,You Obviously Love Oreos,Young Optimistic Life Outlook,You Only Live Once,D,YOLO became popular as a motto to seize the moment and take chances.
```

#### Best Practices for Adding Questions:

1. **Make Wrong Answers Plausible**: Create believable alternatives that sound reasonable
   - ‚ùå Bad: "CPU = Cute Purple Unicorn" (too obviously wrong)
   - ‚úÖ Good: "CPU = Core Processing Unit" (sounds technical and plausible)

2. **Balance Your Correct Answers**: Distribute correct answers across A, B, C, D
   - Check distribution: `tail -n +2 initializer.csv | cut -d',' -f9 | sort | uniq -c`
   - Aim for roughly 25% in each option

3. **Keep Explanations Educational**: Add interesting facts, not just the definition
   - ‚ùå Basic: "CPU means Central Processing Unit"
   - ‚úÖ Better: "The CPU executes instructions and is the brain of the computer"

4. **Group Similar Difficulty**: Mix easy and hard questions
   - Easy: Common terms like USB, PDF, FAQ
   - Medium: Technical terms like API, SQL, HTML
   - Hard: Specialized terms like PCMCIA, TWAIN, MIDI

5. **Test Your Questions**: After adding new questions:
   - Ensure no typos or formatting errors
   - Verify the correct answer is actually correct
   - Check that the game still loads properly

#### Quick Method to Add Questions:

1. **Direct CSV Edit** (for a few questions):
   ```bash
   # Open the CSV file in your favorite editor
   nano public/data/initializer.csv
   # Add new rows at the end
   ```

2. **Using a Spreadsheet** (for bulk additions):
   - Open `initializer_questions_complete.xlsx` in Excel/Google Sheets
   - Add new rows in the "Quiz Questions" tab
   - Export as CSV to `public/data/initializer.csv`

3. **Via Google Sheets** (for collaborative editing):
   - Upload the CSV to Google Sheets
   - Share with collaborators to add questions
   - Publish as CSV and update the game's `sheetUrl`

#### Categories for Expansion Ideas:

- **Medical**: MRI, EKG, ICU, ER, IV, ADHD, OCD
- **Military**: AWOL, MIA, POW, SEAL, NATO, DEFCON
- **Sports**: ESPN, UFC, FIFA, NBA, NFL, MVP
- **Music**: DJ, MP3, EDM, R&B, CD, LP
- **Food**: MSG, GMO, EVOO, BLT, PB&J
- **Travel**: TSA, ETA, GPS, SUV, RV, ATV
- **Social Media**: DM, RT, AMA, TBT, FOMO, SMH
- **Gaming**: RPG, FPS, NPC, DLC, MMO, RNG
- **Finance**: ROI, IPO, ETF, APR, IRA, ATM

The game automatically handles any number of questions - just keep adding rows!

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Ready for Cloudflare Pages deployment
